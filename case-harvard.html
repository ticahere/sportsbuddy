                        <p>In collaboration with the Harvard men’s basketball team, SportsBuddy.ai have demonstrated the impact of our innovative solution on transforming traditional sports footage into engaging, insightful highlights. This case study highlights our partnership with Harvard MBB in the 2023-2024 season, promoting marketing, branding, and athletic communications through engaging sports storytelling.

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Problem</h2>
                        <p>Amateur and collegiate teams often lack the advanced technology needed to produce professional-quality highlight reels, which are crucial for enhancing player visibility, game analysis, and fan engagement. Traditional methods of creating these reels are time-consuming, require specialized skills, and often fail to provide the professional insights needed to fully understand the game. This results in reduced engagement and limited information conveyed through videos.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Solution</h2>
                        <p>SportsBuddy.ai addresses these challenges with a user-friendly platform that leverages AI and deep sports analytic insights to augment basketball game footage intelligently.
