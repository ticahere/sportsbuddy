    "intro": "The Fo Guang Cup is a prestigious international basketball tournament, attracting university teams from across the globe to compete at a high level. Held annually in Taiwan, the 2024 edition of the tournament featured teams from regions such as Australia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, and the United States. Beyond the fierce competition, the Fo Guang Cup also serves as a platform for cultural exchange and global unity, showcasing the unifying power of sports.",

        "paragraphs": [
          "<br/> Despite the excitement and talent on display at the Fo Guang Cup, the tournament faced challenges in effectively capturing and promoting the high-level performances of its participating teams. Traditional video editing tools are often too complex, time-consuming, and require specialized skills that many teams and leagues do not possess. As a result, the league struggled to provide compelling highlight reels that could increase audience engagement, showcase player talent, and offer deeper insights into the games. The absence of high-quality, easily shareable content limited the tournament’s ability to extend its reach and maximize its impact."
